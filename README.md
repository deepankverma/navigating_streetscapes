# Navigating Streetscapes
A large-scale categorized aerial Lidar dataset for street level research.


## Overview
This repository is dedicated to providing openly accessible categorized aerial Lidar datasets along with detailed methodology for data preparation. 
The repositiory has two main parts. First, It explains the process for raw point cloud categorization. The process includes fusion of other geodatasets 
such as 2D street shapefiles and shadow maps. Secondly, it provides supporting codes and scripts to replicate the steps leading to the final dataset. It also 
provides example scripts to reproduce a [research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.104673) study focused on generating city-wide street cross-sections which 
uses the categorized point cloud data generated in the repository.
